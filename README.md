TODO/Features:

-needs to have some sort of advancement (like how you have separate planets and resets in other idle games)
-can add an idle functionality using time to calculate how long someone's been gone and pay accordingly
-needs upgrades
-way to manually click for money and be able to upgrade that somehow
